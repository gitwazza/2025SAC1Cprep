# 2025SAC1Cprep

This project is intended as a preparatory task for the SAC 1D test. It covers a number of steps which build on previous steps. Each step has an associated explanation and in some instances separate starter files/code. 
You are going to create a booking system for a Smarthouse tour.
Your will do this by creating programs of increasing complexity as you work through each step.

The steps are as follows:
1. [step one](docs/step1.md)
2. [step two](docs/step2.md)

We are going to do the following in each of the steps
1. start by storing bookings in a list of booking objects.
   1. initially create the init function, without any error checking
2. add in error checking 
   - firstly without getter and setter 
      4. then with getter/property and setter
         4. by the end of this stage the program will be able to create a list of bookings
2.
