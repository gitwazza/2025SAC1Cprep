# Step 1

In this step you need to create a program which creates a Python list of bookings.
For each booking you need to store the following:
1. `first` name,
2. `last` name,
3. contact mobile phone number, and 
4. the number of people who the contact has booked for.

You have been given a starting program (step1.py), which implements some of these features. Currently, the program only stores the first and last names into the list. 

Note: at this stage we are not trying to store the data into a file nor create a GUI.


### What you are required to do
1. modify the Booking class so that it also stores the mobile number and number of guests. The names of these variables should be:
   - `mobile`, and
   - `no_of_guests`
2. add internal documentation which meets with the standards, described [here](https://sites.google.com/bssc.edu.au/bssd34/unit-3/area-of-study-1-programming/internal-documentation).

Save your completed file as **step1*firstamelastname*.py** - where _firstname_ is your first 
name and _lastname_ is your lastname.
