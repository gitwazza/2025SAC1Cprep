# Step 1

In this step you need to create a program which creates a Python list of bookings.
For each booking you need to store the following:
1. `first` name,
2. `last` name,
3. contact mobile phone number, and 
4. the number of people who the contact has booked for.

You have been given a starting program (step1.py), which implements some of these features. Currently, the program only stores the first and last names into the list. 

### What you are required to do
1. modify the Booking class so that it also stores the mobile number and number of guests. The names of these variables should be:
   - `mobile`, and
   - `no_of_guests`
2. add internal documentation which meets with the standards
   which I'm yet to update but these will include documenting the 
   funtioning of the module
